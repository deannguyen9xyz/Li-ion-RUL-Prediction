# Li-ion-RUL-Prediction
Analysis of Lithium-ion battery degradation using NASA datasets. Features data visualization, statistical curve fitting, and Machine Learning models to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

....updating....

Script 1: 01_visualization.py => Visualize the raw data to understand physical degradation.

Script 2: 02_correlation.py => Mathematically prove which physical parameters drive the aging process.

Script 3: 03_machine_learning.py => Train an ML model to predict RUL for an unseen battery.

## 📊 Conclusion

Script 1 (01_visualization) : All cells (B5, B6, B7) demonstrate expected capacity fade over their cycle life, confirming the degradation phenomenon.

Script 2 (02_correlation) : chT, disT, disV are better raw predictors than chV, chI, disI.
